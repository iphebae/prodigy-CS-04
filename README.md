Basic Keylogger   

This keylogger is a simple Python program that records keystrokes and saves them to a text file
It listens for keyboard input and logs both regular characters (letters, numbers, symbols) and special keys 

How It Works
1. Monitors Keystrokes – Uses the `pynput` library to detect key presses.  
2. Logs Keystrokes– Saves typed keys into a file 
3. Runs in the Background– Continues recording until stopped manually.
